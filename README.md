Car Price Prediction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a Streamlit-based web application for predicting car prices using a machine learning model.


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
This application loads a pre-trained machine learning model and allows users to input various features of a car to predict its price. Users can input parameters such as car model, year, motor type, running status, color, car type, status, and motor volume. The application then utilizes these inputs to make predictions using the trained model.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).
3. Install the required dependencies by running:

(pip install streamlit pandas joblib)


4. Download the pre-trained machine learning model file (RF_model.pkl) and the dataset file (test.csv) and place them in the same directory as the application.


Usage
~~~~~
1. Run the Streamlit application by executing the following command in your terminal:

(streamlit run Test_001.py)


2. Once the application is running, you can interact with it through the web browser.
3. Select the car model, year, motor type, running status, color, car type, status, and motor volume using the provided input fields.
4. Click the "Car Price Prediction" button to see the predicted price for the specified car.


Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Streamlit: for building and running the web application.
Pandas: for data manipulation and handling.
Joblib: for loading the pre-trained machine learning model.
